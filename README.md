# Context Implementation
The Context API is used to manage task state globally.

## TaskContext.js
### State Variables:
- `tasks`: Array holding active tasks
- `completedTasks`: Array holding completed tasks

### Functions:
- `addTask`: Adds new task to active tasks list
- `removeTask`: Removes task from active tasks list
- `completeTask`: Moves task from active to completed, then removes from active tasks

# Components
## Home.js
**Purpose**:  
Displays active tasks and allows users to add new tasks

**Features**:
- Input field for new tasks
- Buttons for marking tasks as completed or deleting them
- Navigation link to view completed tasks

## CompletedTasks.js
**Purpose**:  
Displays tasks that have been marked as completed

**Features**:
- List of completed tasks
- Message when no tasks are completed
- Navigation link to return to Home page

# Routing
Managed using React Router with routes defined in App.js:
- **Home Route** (`/`): Renders Home component
- **Completed Route** (`/completed`): Renders CompletedTasks component

# Styling
Managed through CSS with:
- `App.css`: Global styling
- `Home.css`: Home component styles
- `CompletedTasks.css`: CompletedTasks component styles
